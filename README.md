Generate image of random hexagonal tilings

In this demo you can:
-   regenerate the random image
-   enable/disable layers by clicking the layer buttons
-   re-order layers by dragging the layer buttons left/right
-   save as an image (the whole canvas)
-   save as a tileable image (both x and y direction)
-   drag a tile and drop on the canvas to allow further editing

This demonstrates:
-   simple canvas drawing
-   constrained button draggging
-   drag/drop an image onto canvas
-   saving an image
-   putting metadata into a png file
-   extracting metadata from a png file
-   module imports including import-for-effect
